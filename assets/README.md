### PokeAPI lab

Let's be the very best, that no one ever was.
To make API calls is our quest
DOM Manipulation is our cause!


For this lab lets create our own Pokedex by making an Axios call to the PokeAPI!
Lets first create an html file, attach in our JS Script file and the Axios library, and enter in a search bar and button to submit in our API call
We can put in some empty HTML elements as well to populate with our response data, in this case just an H2 and an Image, but we can put in as much as we want once we get our calls made. Scaffold in a CSS file to add some style once the data is rendered on screen too!


Explore the https://pokeapi.co/ API to see what types of endpoints are available, and what your data will look like

You may need to Map through and run some conditionals for some peices of information (abilities, types...) if you want to put in additional peices of API data 

```html
<form>
    <input type="text"  value="" placeholder="Choose your pokemon!"  id="inputBar">
    <input type="button"  value="Click here" id="searchButton">
</form>

<h2 id="pokemonName"> </h2>
<img id="pokemonImage"/>

 
```

We'll need to Get some DOM elements, then run our Axios call to make the API call.
Once we have our data pulled and logged, we can render it on screen.
By wrapping our function up in a button's callback, we will only trigger it when the button is clicked, and the input is entered

```js
let button = document.querySelector("#searchButton")

button.addEventListener('click', async () => {

    let pokemonName = document.querySelector("#pokemonName")
    let pokemonImage = document.querySelector("#pokemonImage")
    //where does this need to be scoped?
    let textInput = document.querySelector("#inputBar").value
        

    //Axios call goes here
    //remember to use Async and Await!
    //DOM Setters go here

}
)

```

Once you have the initial data rendered, try to add as much as possible. We can search Pokemon by names and numbers, can we also search for Moves, Berries, and other information?


Finally, this is a chance to really explore your styling skills. Be sure to create some wireframes to work with before creating something you can really show off, and have fun with!
